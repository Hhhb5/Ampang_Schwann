My code is a rock, paper. and scissors game, I will explain the parts of the code and purposes.

import random

option = ("rock"), ("paper"), ("scissors") - This part of the code is the options that the players can pick, which is rock, paper, and scissors.
playing = True                               Purpose: The player can choose an option.


while playing:
    
    player = None
    computer = random.choice(option) - This part of the code is where the computer will generate a choice randomly and the player can choose between the options
                                       computer = random.choice(options) = the part of the code where the bot can generate a random choice from rock, paper and scissors.
                                       Purpose: The player can choose within the options and the bot will generate a random choice within the options.

    while player not in option:
        player = input("Enter a choice(rock,paper,scissors): ") - This part is where if the player does not choose within the options it will not generate a result though the computer will
                                                                generate a response (example: computer: rock) it will not give a result like You win! or You lose! it will make you choose again
                                                                                              player: gun   ) from rock, paper, and scissors.   
                                                                  Purpose: For that the player cant type anything else and only within the options.


        print(f"Player: {player}")
        print(f"Computer: {computer}") - This part of code is using f-strings (formatted string literals) in Python to print the values of the variables player and computer in a formatted way.
                                         Purpose: To print the values of the player and computer.

    if player == computer:
       print("Its a tie!")
    elif player == "rock" and computer == "paper":
       print("You lose!")
    elif player == "scissors" and computer == "paper":  - This part of the code are the results for a specfic combination(Example is if you pull in rock, and the computer is rock its a tie)
       print("You win")                                   Purpose: To have a result after each round
       print("You lose!")
    elif player == "scissors" and computer == "rock":
       print("You lose!")
    else:
        print("You lose!")

    play_again = input("Play Again? (y/n) ").lower() - This part is after the result. After showing the result like You lose! and You win! you get the option to play again, though a bit bugged because
    if not play_again == "y":                          even if you choose "n" you will still be forced to play
       running = False                                 Purpose: For the player to pick an option to continue or no
